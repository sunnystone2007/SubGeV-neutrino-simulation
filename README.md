# SubGeV-neutrino-simulation

Here I summarize what I have done already.  
1.Remarks on event.py  
A.Use PrintTracksEnergy to get the energy, position and particle information  
B.PrintTracksEnergy_ignoreneutron is an improvement on PrintTracksEnergy but ignore particle with pdg 2112  
C.selectneutronevent used as find those events with Neutron coming out of Neutrino interaction   
D.
