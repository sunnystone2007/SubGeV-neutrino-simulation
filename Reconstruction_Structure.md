From printtracks in event read energy deposition, pdg code, x,y,z coordinate  

add a "CheckOneNeutronEvent" to make sure there is one neutron coming out of first vertex, if not,  select the one with smallest pdg code  

add a "neutron_direction" function in event, input the information in printtracks, print out the real nuetron direction, calculated neutron direction  
and the cos angle between two angles.
