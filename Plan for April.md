#here is a plan for April 2025  
1. add neutron momentum information
2. reconstruct based on purely energy decomposition
3. add a histogram of cos(theta_real-theta_simulated) to present
4. further add electron momentum information for reconstruction
5. testify the hypothesis of one neutron per event is possible
